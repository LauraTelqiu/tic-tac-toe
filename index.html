        <p>
          The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a
          row.The player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate
          placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row,
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the
          grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a
          row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither
          player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
